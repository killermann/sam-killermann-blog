<p>This theme was created for my &quot;official&quot; blog. You can check that out at <a href="http://samkillermann.com">http://samkillermann.com</a> to see it in action.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not designed to be easily implemented by other bloggers (not a lot of customization, and I have some copy hard-coded into the theme), but it will totally work with a little elbow grease and know-how -- and it&#39;s all yours.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Download the .ZIP version of this repo and upload it as a theme on your Wordpress install.</p>
<p>You can add your own custom logo and customize a few other things in the Wordpress theme customizer.</p>
<p>Hard-coded things you&#39;ll <em>definitely</em> want to update or delete:</p>
<ul>
<li>footer.php has hard-coded copy, links to my social, and my mailing list (all of which you can easily change to your stuff)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hard-coded things you&#39;ll <em>probably want</em> to update or delete:</p>
<ul>
<li>header.php has sign up / sign in menus (delete if you&#39;re not creating a subscription site)</li>
<li>page-sign-up.php has links to my mailing list and patreon (if you want to keep it, update the links and FAQ to your stuff</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="plays-nice-with-">Plays Nice with...</h2>
<p><strong>Patreon for Wordpress Plugin</strong>: if you&#39;re wanting to use Patreon (using the official Patreon for Wordpress Plugin) to create members-only parts of your blog, this theme was designed to integrate that plugin seamlessly (you&#39;ll just have to change a couple links).</p>
<p><strong>Yoast SEO Plugin</strong>: I&#39;d strongly suggest using Yoast if you use this theme (or in general), because I&#39;ve integrated Primary Categories, Breadcrumbs, and a few other Yoast-y things. However, it shouldn&#39;t break if you don&#39;t use Yoast (no promises).</p>
<p><strong>Mailchimp</strong>: I have a couple Mailchimp forms embedded throughout the theme, and a shortcode that displays a Mailchimp signup within posts (that shortcode is [mailinglist]). Swap my Mailchimp credentials for your list and you&#39;re good to go.</p>
<h2 id="support">Support</h2>
<p>I do not support this theme, or any of my other code. This is a big ol&#39; <strong>USE AT YOUR OWN CONVENIENCE/RISK/EXPERTISE</strong> repo. If you don&#39;t understand the code, it&#39;s probably best that you don&#39;t implement it.</p>
<p><strong>Please do not email me, or reach out in any other way, with questions about implementing or customizing this theme.</strong> I won&#39;t reply, which will make me feel bad, then you&#39;ll feel bad. Avoid the bads.</p>
<p>But <strong>can you pay me to implement/customize this for you?</strong> What if you pay me a lot of money? Does that change the above rule? It does not. You may not. I will not.</p>
