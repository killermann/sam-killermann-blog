# The "Sam Killermann Blog" Wordpress Theme

This theme was created for my "official" blog. You can check that out at http://samkillermann.com to see it in action.

It's not designed to be easily implemented by other bloggers (not a lot of customization, and I have some copy hard-coded into the theme), but it will totally work with a little elbow grease and know-how -- and it's all yours.

## Installation

Download the .ZIP version of this repo and upload it as a theme on your Wordpress install.

You can add your own custom logo and customize a few other things in the Wordpress theme customizer.

Hard-coded things you'll _definitely_ want to update or delete:
- footer.php has hard-coded copy, links to my social, and my mailing list (all of which you can easily change to your stuff)

Hard-coded things you'll _probably want_ to update or delete:
- header.php has sign up / sign in menus (delete if you're not creating a subscription site)
- page-sign-up.php has links to my mailing list and patreon (if you want to keep it, update the links and FAQ to your stuff

## Plays Nice with...

__Patreon for Wordpress Plugin__: if you're wanting to use Patreon (using the official Patreon for Wordpress Plugin) to create members-only parts of your blog, this theme was designed to integrate that plugin seamlessly (you'll just have to change a couple links).

__Yoast SEO Plugin__: I'd strongly suggest using Yoast if you use this theme (or in general), because I've integrated Primary Categories, Breadcrumbs, and a few other Yoast-y things. However, it shouldn't break if you don't use Yoast (no promises).

__Mailchimp__: I have a couple Mailchimp forms embedded throughout the theme, and a shortcode that displays a Mailchimp signup within posts (that shortcode is <pre>[mailinglist]</pre>). Swap my Mailchimp credentials for your list and you're good to go.

## Support?

Nope! This theme is unsupported. Use it if you'd like, however you'd like, but please know that I can't help you out (beyond just making it available for download).
